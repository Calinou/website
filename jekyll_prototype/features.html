          <h2>Native performance with state of the art optimisations</h2>
          <h3>
            By compiling to C, Nim is able to take advantage of a wide range of mature
            C compilers. Because of this Nim is incredibly portable and is able to
            use all of the optimisations built into the toolchain.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            The binaries produced by Nim have zero dependencies and are
            typically very small. This makes distribution of binaries easy
            and keeps your users happy.
