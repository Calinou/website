	<h1 class="text-centered page-title">Installation from GitHub</h1>

	<p> <a href="http://github.com/nim-lang/nim">GitHub</a> is where Nim's development takes place.</p>
	<p>You may wish to grab the latest development version of Nim, because sometimes bug fixes and new features may not have made it to an official release yet.</p>
	<p>In those circumstances you are better off grabbing the current development branch.</p>

	<p>You will also need to do this if you would like to contribute to Nim.</p>

	<p>Before you download the code, open a new terminal and <code>cd</code> into the directory where you would like the download to take place.</p>

	<p>The following commands can be used to download the current development branch and then to build it:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim.git
cd Nim
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nim-lang/csources
cd csources && sh build.sh
cd ..
bin/nim c koch
./koch boot -d:release
</code></pre>

<p>You should then add the <code>./bin</code> (make sure to expand this into an absolute path) directory to your <code>PATH</code>.</p>

<p>You can also run <code>./koch tools</code> to build nimble and nimsuggest.</p>
