# Chat rooms

By far the quickest and easiest way to get involved in our community is
by joining one of our chat rooms.

Our official chat room is the #nim channel on irc.freenode.net. You can
access it in multiple ways:

<i class="fa fa-desktop li" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Use an [IRC client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat#Clients)
to connect to irc.freenode.net and join the #nim channel

<i class="fa fa-globe li" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Join the Gitter chat room, which relays messages both ways between IRC and
Gitter, by clicking [here](https://gitter.im/nim-lang/Nim).

You can join this chat room to ask a quick question, or engage in a discussion
about features and projects that interest you. For formal feature requests and
issue reporting consult the [Issues and RFCs](#issues-and-rfcs) section.

Be aware that all messages in Gitter and IRC are logged.
You can access the IRC logs of the #nim channel
[here](https://irclogs.nim-lang.org).

The #nim channel is primarily for on-topic discussion. There is also a
semi-official #nim-offtopic channel for off-topic discussion.

# Forum

This is a good place for long questions or to gauge the community's interest
on specific topics such as new features.

# Issues and RFCs

The issue tracker is hosted on GitHub together with the main repository.
Most projects under the Nim umbrella have their own issue tracker:


* [Nim compiler and standard library issue tracker](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues)

* [Nimsuggest issue tracker](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimsuggest/issues)

* [Nimble issue tracker](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble/issues)

* [NimForum issue tracker](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimsuggest/issues)

* [This website's issue tracker](https://github.com/nim-lang/website/issues)

If you have found an issue in the compiler, the standard library or any of
the tools then please create an issue in the relevant repository. If
appropriate include a minimal example reproducing the issue.

If you have a feature request then consider creating a formal RFC
(Request for comments). In it you should describe the feature clearly,
including the use cases that you foresee for the feature and anything else
that you think is relevant. RFCs are currently submitted to the
issue tracker.
