# Nim website development

## `jekyll_prototype`

A [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) prototype (news entries are copy-pasted from
the current site). Install Jekyll, then use `jekyll serve` to serve to a local
Web server with automatic refresh on changes.

## Nim implementation

The prototype is obsolete soon. Build the website via:

`nim c -r src/nimweb.nim`
